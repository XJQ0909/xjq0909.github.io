## How to Run This Repo Locally
- First, download the repository.
- Ensure that you have the Live Server extension installed in VS Code.
- Open the folder in VS Code, then select the index.html file.
- Right-click on index.html and choose "Open with Live Server".

## How to Update the Blog
- Place the new Markdown file in the blogs folder.
- In script.js, add the name of the new blog to the **blogFiles** array.

## Possible Improvements
- Since this is a static website, updating the blogs manually can be a bit tedious. We could introduce a **backend database**, so new blogs don't have to be added manually.
- As the number of blogs increases, we might consider implementing **AI-assisted categorization** and **search functionality**.
